Code for the paper ["Simulating Majorana zero modes on a noisy quantum processor"](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/acb796) [[arXiv version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00563)].

This experiment simulates Majorana zero modes on the IBM Quantum hardware.
The documentation for this module consists of three notebooks:

1. The [tutorial](docs/tutorial.ipynb) contains background information and shows how the building blocks
   of the experiment were implemented.
2. The [data collection notebook](docs/data-collection.ipynb) contains the code used to collect experimental data.
3. The [analysis notebook](docs/analysis.ipynb) contains the code used to analyze the data and generate plots.
